# break_in_to_it
How to get a job in IT with non-traditional qualifications.

## Right way
- [ ] Expect to spend a year of your leisure time doing side projects writing code
- [ ] Study using any resource possible, including bots. If you use bots, go out of your way to indicate how much of your code is your vs bot written.
- [ ] Review all the specialities. Some are easier to break into, e.g. some automated testing, data work, work that involves using an app's semi-programming (think MS Office Macros)
- [ ] Temporarily care about it. No one who shovels shit for pay has a passion for shoveling shit. Knowledge work is different and more so if you aren't being hand led through an educaton at college. During the time that no one is telling you what to do, you need to have a side project that you care about. A side project that is incomplete and sloppy because the author didn't care and didn't care because no one was paying them to do it shows and doesn't make a good impression.

## Evidences of being a real person and competent developer
- [ ] A social media presence. Act like you are there to socialize. Tell work stories, ask work questions. Follow 1000 people in your field.
- [ ] A github account with one really good app, and many small proof-of-concept apps
- [ ] Publish the demo app to somewhere, e.g. with free or cheap hosting. You paid $$$ for the machine you code on, don't decide you have no money for hosting now. But also don't run up a 
$10,0000 AWS bill by accident. You want people to be able to see it with 1 click in a browser.

- [ ] Don't buy more than 1 domain name, a live site with an ungly domain is better than a dead site with a clever domain because you couldn't warrant keeping up with the SSL cert and annual domain fees.
- [ ] Blog about your experiences
- [ ] Record a talking head youtube video. Use zoom, keep it under 20 minutes, speak from notes, don't edit unless you enjoy video editing and have the time. Video editing is nearly a whole career speciality.
- [ ] Ask and answers on Stack-overflow. You are asking to get and answer and to establish reputation. If you ask a lazy "can you do it for me" question, that is what employers will expect you to do on the job.


## Wrong way
- [ ] Do nothing
- [ ] Do very little
- [ ] Plan to only do anything after you get a job and someone is providing you 40 hours a week of on the job training
- [ ] Lying on the resume
- [ ] Letting a bot write the "human touch" bits, like the cover letter, job goal on the resume, etc.
- [ ] Letting your staffing agent lie on your resume for you
- [ ] Asking someone else to solve your take home
- [ ] Googling interview questions as they are being asked
- [ ] Having one person do the coding interview and another person 
- [ ] Have one person do the interview, another person show up for work
